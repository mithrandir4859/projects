Which I certainly noticed after Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems is creating confusion around Java certifications like hell. I used to remember those days, where Java Certifications are well defined and well known e.g. SCJP, SCWCD, SCBCD etc, but currently Java certification for SE 7 is known as either SCJP 7, OCJP 7 or even OCPJP 7. By the way official name of two most sought after Java certifications are Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 7 Programmer ( Code : 1Z0-803) and Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 7 Programmer ( Code 1Z0-804 ).  I receive lots of questions regarding Java Certifications for Java SE 6 and 7, with range of queries from how to prepare for exam, to suggestions on books, resources and mock exam simulators. One of the questions, which lot of my reader email me is about, whether taking OCAJP is mandatory for giving OCPJP or not?  Many of them have doubt about whether OCA is required for taking OCP or not? Well, answer is both Yes and No. If  you are appearing for Java SE 7 certification and haven't done any Java certification before than you need to first clear OCAJP and only than you can take OCPJP, but if you are upgrading from an earlier version e.g. you have already passed Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 6 or SE 5 Programmer (OCPJP 6 or OCPJP 5) or any version of Sun Certified Java programmer exam ( SCJP) than you don't need to go through OCA path. You can directly appear for OCPJP 7. By the way exam code is different for upgrade version, you need to take 1Z0-805, Upgrade to Java SE 7 Programmer. On similar note, if you are appearing for Java SE 6 certification than you don't need to pass OCA, you can directly take Java 1.6 certification. ahahahahahax
